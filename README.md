# AGRIFEED - IOT-ML Based System to Estimate Nitrogen and Identify Disease in Rice Leaves

AGRIFEED is an IoT platform that aims to help rice farmers manage leaf diseases and determine the correct amount of fertilizer for cultivation. The system uses an Android application and employs two machine learning data models hosted on AWS for fertilizer quantity determination and disease identification. By quickly detecting leaf diseases and analyzing leaf color for fertilizer guidance, the platform is designed to increase yields and make rice cultivation more sustainable for Sri Lankan farmers.
